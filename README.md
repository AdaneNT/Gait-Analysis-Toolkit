# Gait-Analysis-

Gait analysis (GA) toolkit is a machine learning-based human activity recognition tool developed for detecting common activities of daily living (ADLs), such as walking, jogging, going upstairs, going downstairs, sitting, and standing. The GA toolkit contains a pre-trained model based on the smartphone acceleration dataset obtained from wearable inertial sensors.
