Gait analysis (GA) toolkit is a machine learning-based module developed for detecting common activities of daily living (ADLs), 
such as walking, jogging, going upstairs, going downstairs, sitting, and standing. The GA toolkit contains a pre-trained model based on the smartphone 
acceleration dataset obtained from wearable inertial sensors.
